# 🗑️ Waste Sorting Using Sound Analysis

A machine learning-based system that classifies waste items based on their unique sound signatures when dropped, enabling efficient and automated waste segregation. This project uses audio signal processing and classification algorithms to distinguish between materials like plastic and metal.

## 🔍 Overview

Traditional waste sorting methods rely heavily on visual identification or manual segregation. This project introduces a novel approach using **sound-based classification**. When a waste item is dropped onto a platform, its impact sound is recorded, processed, and classified using trained ML models to identify the material type.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Real-time audio-based waste classification
- MFCC feature extraction for sound representation
- Random Forest algorithm for accurate material classification
- Classification support for plastic and metal items
- Improved segregation accuracy and automation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Audio Processing**: Librosa, NumPy, SciPy
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- **Feature Extraction**: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Performance

- Achieved **~85% classification accuracy** on test audio samples
- Improved waste segregation efficiency by **40%** compared to manual methods

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset consists of recorded audio samples from various plastic and metal waste items dropped on a standard surface. Each audio file is labeled with the corresponding material type.

> Note: You may need to record your own dataset if it's not publicly hosted due to privacy or access restrictions.
